## Project Description / Outline

This project aims to build an auction marketplace used to make cryptocurrency bids on a minted NFT.  Through the use of smart contracts, an image of a movie poster will be minted into an NFT, deployable on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.  This movie poster NFT will then be used as an asset, and bids fascilitated using Eth. Finally, using the streamlit interface, a Front-End web application will behave as the User Interface for auction. 

## NFT
- Programming language: Solidity
- contract for an ArtToken, operating on the ERC721 chain. This ensures that the token being minted is unique.
- Finally, minting the tokenID and finalizing the NFT. 
 
### Certificate
- The Certificate smart contract behaves as a digital receipt. 
- Imported OpenZepplin contract code. 
- The ABI signature is saved in a json file. This encodes the certificate of the NFT.
